# highlogger

With the recent changes to [bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) there is no more need for highlogger so I recommend switching since highloggerer will not be maintained anymore. For syslog you can add [bunyan-syslog-udp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan-syslog-udp). Even though bunyan-syslog-udp hasn't been updated for two years it still works without issues for my setup on node v8.5.
